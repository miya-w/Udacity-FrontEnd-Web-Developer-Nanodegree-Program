          <h2>How to work from home?</h2> 
          
            <p>
                We started working from since March 2020. <br>
                It wasn't in our plan, Just one day, my partner told me his company told him "Tomorrow, everyone works from home." 
                The next working day, we just start working on our dining table in our small apartment. 
                The first week is the most unproductive days ever. We don't know how long it gonna be? 
                Should we really buy the desk table and suck in our tiny living room? How to draw a line between working and break when we stay at home?

                When we finally got time to go to IKEA for setting up our home office on the first weekend, and we found lots of people had flocked to IKEA.
                Most of the desks, chairs and office furniture had been out of stock. We were so speechless and feel everything is so unreal.  
                Fortuninary, our ordered table came to us by mail after a couple of days. in these days, 
                we made lots of adjustments and comprising, so I sum up these working from home tips below through my personal experience.
