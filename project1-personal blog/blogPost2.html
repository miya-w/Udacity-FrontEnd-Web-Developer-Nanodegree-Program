          <h1>How do you eat in pandemic?</h1>
          <p>
                Since the lockdown, Melbournies experience twice panic buying. The most well-know one is probably the toilet paper, 
                this whole city had no toilet paper in retailers in weeks.The Covid-19 made the toilet paper like the sweet, hot weed which 
                you only can get from the black market. Not only the toilet paper, it also happen in the other grocery products. It seems the 
                panic buying always comes after the new restriction announcement. Even thought the restriction has eased gradually, The hoarding 
                of toilet paper feels like yesterday.LoL 
            <br>
            <br>
                It looks unusual, but it did make sense that people avoid any chance to go to a crowded place, but the thing is "We need survival!" 
                In this time, the way how we buy, cook and eat the food.
            <br>
                What a lucky thing is I living in Australia, which is definitely a self-sufficient continent with its thriving agriculture industries! 
                So, at that point, I still got some confident the supplies of food and never worried about the shortage.
                So, I just sum up some tips from my grocery experience in this lockdown time and share it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Don't hoard,  Don't hoard,  Don't hoard.</h3>
                <p> I have to say that again because
                 the food has its lifespan. Not only eating food out of date is never be pleasant, it can also be unhealthy. 
                if you are interested to know how long you can preserve the food, The article <a href="https://www.canstarblue.com.au/appliances/shelf-life-guide-foods-fridge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                <span class="underderLineWord">A shelf life guide to the foods in your fridge</span> </a> might give you some tips!
                </p>


            <h3>Always have alternative options</h3>
                <p>
                Keep this in your mind!  This is probably one of the most valuable things I have learned from this lock time! It helps me be calm when things are getting chaotic.
                For example,  when the toilet paper is out of the shelves, you still can have the other option, such as wet wipe, tissue, clothe, even the kitchen towel (I know its
                not a good experience, but try to dip it gently instead of wiping) When you find the products you want to buy is out in a supermarket, try the other retailers. 
                When I can't get the toilet paper in the Woolworth, guess where did I find it in the end? it's the IGA in the corner near my apartment!

            <h3>Choose versatile food</h3>
                <p>
                    Since the restaurants are shut down and you can't go out for a long time in the pandemic. Cooking is essential no matter you like it or not. For some people, 
                    like me, has little experience is definitely a new journey!  So I tried to make everything easy, let's start from the recipe ingredient!  Try the Versatile Food!
                    I just list some of my personal preference! 
                </p>
                <br>

               
                <p>
                <i><b>My top No.1 : EGG! </b> </i>
                <br>
                Like Anton Taiki said in 
                    <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-possibly-the-most-versatile-and-best-food-of-all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

                        <q id="egg">
                            Eggs are the most versatile food. A staple in the kitchen, a superfood. They can be a dish by itself, complement ingredients, or blend into food. They can thicken, 
                            leaven, glaze, bind or garnish. They are nutritious and delicious.
                            So the egg is my top one without question.

                <p>
                    <i><b>No 2. Rice</b></i>
                    <br>
                        The three reason I would put rice as my top three: Easy-to-make!  easy-to-store! and easy-to-use! 
                        Even though I have been in Australia for six years, I still can't move the rice from my dish! 
                        Rice is the traditional food staple in Asia, steaming rice is always an essential part of dinner in my family since I had the memory.
                        Most of the time, rice is used to a side-dish. The only three ways I have learned: steam rice, fried rice and rice soup, 
                        but I am surprised that the rice has so many ways to cook!

            <h3> Choose the food with long life</h3>
                <p>
                    Try to get the longer life food as possible as you can.
                    For example, the root vegetable is easy to preserve than fresh, grain, bean, canned veg are some good options.  
                </p>
               
            <h3>Try the meal kit subscription food</h3>
                <p>We never thought we would use the meal kit subscription before pandemic, because we had spontaneous schedule of dinner. 
                    During the lock down time,we found meal kit subscription food not only help us went through the panic buying but also make me to learn the different cuisine.

                </p>
            <h3>Measuring food consumption!</h3>
                <p>
                    I feel this is a very useful method help me to shop efficiently and stop over shopping!
                    I just sum up the food consumption into a list. This are the food we(my partner and I ) eat in a week.
