## About the projects ##
---
- P1 - Personal Web Blog
    - Styled Blog Website
        - CSS & Website Layout
        - Create a multi-page blog website, using best practices for content and page styling with HTML and CSS. You’ll practice using responsive layouts, Flexbox, and CSS Grid to create the structure and design for your own blog

- P2 - Landing Page
    - Dynamic Landing Page for Marketing Content
        - JavaScript and the DOM
        - you will be building a multi-section landing page. Often times, you won’t know how much content will be added to a page  through a Content Management System (CSM) or an API. To handle this problem, you will dynamically add content to a web page. You’ll be building a landing page that combines your skills with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to update and control the page and create a dynamic user experience.

- P3 - Weather Journal app
    - Weather Journal
        - Web APIs and Asynchronous Applications
        - Apply your new skills to combine data from the OpenWeatherMap API and client side (browser) HTML forms to create a web app that records a weather journal for users. This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI for a Weather Journal App.
