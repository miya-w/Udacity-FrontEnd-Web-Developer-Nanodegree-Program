          <h2>219 days lockdown days in Melbourne</h2>
          <p>
            My 2020 started with peace and pleasure, we spend our new year camping trip in Grampians National Park, then we flow to Taiwan for voting presidential election.  <br>
            When I was stoped over in Singapore airport, the hustle and bustle shops make this world as usual, but the Taiwanese media started to report the new virus at that point before the world pay attention to this high-contagious virus. I guess Taiwanese has learned a tough lesson from SARS in 2003. Meanwhile, the first case of coronavirus in Australia was detected on January 25,   
            but it wasn't until March that Melbournies daily life really began to change.  
            <br>
            <br>
            
            <span class="underLine">March 23d.</span> the Australian were abruptly forced to change the way they worked, shopped, travelled, socialised and exercised. My partner and I start working from home since March it took us for a while to get used to it. The lockdown did not make the thing better,  The new stage-four restrictions are more strict on August. It brought the curfew.
            
            <br>
            <br>
            
            11.59 pm on <span class="underLine">27 October</span>, people no longer require a reason to leave home, all retail, restaurants, hotels, cafes and bars will be allowed to open with capacity limits, The lockdown is finally ended at 11.59 pm on 27 October, people no longer require a reason to leave home, all retail, restaurants, hotels, cafes and bars will be allowed to open with capacity limits. 
            
            Well, The thing goes well gradually, but Melbourne is not like the same before the pandemic. 
            
            So, I decide to write down this and share with you how did we cope up in this 219 days lockdown.
